Phenology varies within and among populations, and can be influenced by conditions individuals experience both prior to departure and encounter en route. Assessing how intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., individual physical condition vs. environmental conditions) interact to influence variation in migratory phenologies across ecological scales is often limited due to logistical constraints associated with tracking large numbers of individuals from multiple populations simultaneously. We used two natural tags, DNA and otolith microstructure analysis, to estimate the relative influence of individual traits (life-history strategy, body size at departure and growth during migration), population-specific behaviours and interannual variability on the phenology of marine migrations in juvenile sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. We show that the timing and duration of juvenile sockeye salmon migrations were correlated with both life-history strategy and body size, while migration duration was also correlated with departure timing and growth rates during migration. Even after accounting for the effect of individual traits, several populations exhibited distinct migration phenologies. Finally, we observed substantial interannual and residual variation, suggesting stochastic environmental conditions moderate the influence of carry-over effects that develop prior to departure, as well as population-specific strategies. Migratory phenologies are shaped by complex interactions between drivers acting at multiple ecological and temporal scales. Given evidence that intraspecific diversity can stabilize ecological systems, conservation efforts should seek to maintain migratory variation among populations and preserve locally adapted phenotypes; however, variation within populations, which may buffer systems from environmental stochasticity, should also be regularly assessed and preserved.","tags":["Pacific salmon body size carry-over effects life history migration otolith phenology"],"title":"Individual variation, population-specific behaviours and stochastic processes shape marine migration phenologies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Freshwater","Brian J.

We used a constrained dynamic factor analysis to explore patterns of covariance in productivity among 16 Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs). Specifically, we tested whether coherent trends in productivity covaried with five distinct ecological attributes: physical characteristics of nursery lakes, large-scale management interventions, genetic similarity, adult migration phenology, or juvenile migratory traits. The top-ranked model had two trends based on nursery lake characteristics and juvenile migratory traits. One trend represented the dynamics of CUs that rear in nursery lakes prior to ocean entry and undergo relatively rapid marine migrations. The second included a sea-type CU, Harrison River, which enters the marine environment without rearing in a nursery lake and migrates more slowly. The uniform response of lake-type CUs, as well as Harrison River CU’s unique life history, suggests that coherent trends are structured by traits that covary with broad life history type, rather than fine-scale characteristics. Furthermore, we document substantial temporal variability in the strength of synchronous dynamics among Fraser River CUs. Greater synchrony in recent years suggests that the importance of shared regional drivers, relative to local processes, may have increased.","tags":null,"title":"Coherent population dynamics associated with sockeye salmon juvenile life history strategies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Freshwater","Marc Trudel","Terry D.

Juvenile sockeye salmon entering the marine environment during a year with high competitor densities (conspecifics and 9 other pelagic species groups) were, on average, 11% smaller and entered the ocean almost a week earlier. Differences between the high- and low-density years in entry size, but not entry date, were strongest in nursery lakes with high parental spawner abundance, consistent with density-dependent effects on freshwater growth. Mean daily growth rates of sockeye salmon during early marine residence did not vary between years after accounting for variation in ocean entry size and timing, even though the catch per unit effort of the most abundant juvenile salmon species increased more than 5-fold. However, juvenile sockeye salmon entering in the high-density year did migrate away from their ocean entry points significantly more rapidly (estimated ~40% increase in body lengths per second). Our results suggest that juvenile sockeye salmon growth during early marine residence may not be strongly limited by competition and that shifts in migration speed or spatial distribution may buffer individuals from competitive interactions.","tags":null,"title":"Effects of density during freshwater and early marine rearing on juvenile sockeye salmon size, growth, and migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

The nature of this selective pressure depends on whether the outcomes of aggressive contests are asymmetric between species (i.e., one species is consistently dominant), yet few studies have estimated the prevalence of asymmetric versus symmetric outcomes to aggressive contests. Here we use previously published data involving 26,212 interactions between 270 species pairs of birds from 26 taxonomic families to address the question: How often are aggressive interactions among closely related bird species asymmetric? We define asymmetry using (i) the proportion of contests won by one species, and (ii) statistical tests for asymmetric outcomes of aggressive contests. We calculate these asymmetries using data summed across different sites for each species pair, and compare results to asymmetries calculated using data separated by location. We find that 80% of species pairs had aggressive outcomes where one species won 80% or more of aggressive contests. We also find that the majority of aggressive interactions among closely related species show statistically significant asymmetries, and above a sample size of 52 interactions, all outcomes are asymmetric following binomial tests. Species pairs with dominance data from multiple sites showed the same dominance relationship across locations in 93% of the species pairs. Overall, our results suggest that the outcome of aggressive interactions among closely related species are usually consistent and asymmetric, and should thus favor ecological and evolutionary strategies specific to the position of a species within a dominance hierarchy.","tags":["Community ecology Community structure Dominance hierarchy Interspecific aggression Interspecific competition Social dominance Species interactions"],"title":"The outcomes of most aggressive interactions among closely related bird species are asymmetric","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cameron Freshwater","Marc Trudel","Terry D.

Population identity and freshwater age also had strong indirect effects, moderated by size at entry. Conversely, marine growth rates immediately after entry or before capture were relatively weak predictors of size during migration. We next tested for shifts in size distribution indicative of selective mortality, but detected no evidence of smaller individuals experiencing lower survival during early marine migrations. These results indicate that the migratory distributions of juvenile sockeye salmon are influenced by body size and that this variation is predominantly driven by traits present prior to freshwater outmigration, rather than marine growth or differential survival.

These interactions are frequently asymmetric, with one species behaviorally dominant to another and excluding it from preferred resources. Despite the potential importance of this type of interference competition as a source of selection, we know little about patterns of trait divergence between dominant and subordinate species. We compiled published data on phylogenetically independent, closely related species of North American birds where one species was consistently dominant in aggressive interactions with a congeneric species. We then compared the body size, breeding phenology, life history, ecological breadth, and biogeography of these species. After accounting for body size and phylogeny, we found repeated patterns of trait divergence between subordinate and dominant species within genera. Subordinate species that migrated seasonally arrived 4–7 days later than dominants on their sympatric breeding grounds, and both resident and migratory subordinates initiated breeding 7–8 days later than their dominant, sympatric congeners. Subordinate species had a 5.2% higher annual adult mortality rate and laid eggs that were 0.02 g heavier for their body mass. Dominant and subordinate species used a similar number of different foods, foraging behaviors, nest sites, and habitats, but subordinates were more specialized in their foraging behaviors compared with closely related dominant species. The breeding and wintering ranges of subordinate species were 571 km farther apart than the ranges of dominant species, suggesting that subordinate species migrate greater distances. Range sizes and latitudinal distributions did not consistently differ, although subordinate species tended to breed farther north or winter farther south. These results are consistent with dominant species directly influencing the ecological strategies of subordinate species (via plastic or genetically based changes), either by restricting their access to resources or simply through aggression. Alternatively, these ecological traits may covary with patterns of behavioral dominance, with no direct consequences of interactions. Regardless of the mechanism, recognizing that the relative position of a species within a dominance hierarchy is correlated with a suite of other ecological and fitness related traits has far-reaching implications for the mechanisms underlying species distributions and the structure of biological assemblages.","tags":null,"title":"Repeated patterns of trait divergence between closely related dominant and subordinate bird species","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B.

In Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) determines whether species are at risk of extinction or extirpation, and has conducted these assessments since 1977. We examined trends in COSEWIC assessments to identify whether at-risk species that have been assessed more than once tended to improve, remain constant, or deteriorate in status, as a way of assessing the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation in Canada. Of 369 species that met our criteria for examination, 115 deteriorated, 202 remained unchanged, and 52 improved in status. Only 20 species (5.4%) improved to the point where they were 'not at risk', and five of those were due to increased sampling efforts rather than an increase in population size. Species outcomes were also dependent on the severity of their initial assessment; for example, 47% of species that were initially listed as special concern deteriorated between assessments. After receiving an at-risk assessment by COSEWIC, a species is considered for listing under the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), which is the primary national tool that mandates protection for at-risk species. We examined whether SARA-listing was associated with improved COSEWIC assessment outcomes relative to unlisted species. Of 305 species that had multiple assessments and were SARA-listed, 221 were listed at a level that required identification and protection of critical habitat; however, critical habitat was fully identified for only 56 of these species. We suggest that the Canadian government should formally identify and protect critical habitat, as is required by existing legislation. In addition, our finding that at-risk species in Canada rarely recover leads us to recommend that every effort be made to actively prevent species from becoming at-risk in the first place.","tags":["Animals Animals","Wild *Biodiversity Canada Conservation of Natural Resources/*trends Ecosystem Endangered Species/*legislation \u0026 jurisprudence Population Density Population Dynamics Risk Assessment"],"title":"Trends in extinction risk for imperiled species in Canada","type":"publication"}]
